# Quickstart

You can launch the Nuvolos CLI with the `nuvolos` command.

If you are running the CLI on your own computer, you will need to configure your API key. You can do this with the `nuvolos config` command:

```
nuvolos config --api-key <YOUR_API_KEY>
```

You can list all running apps with the `nuvolos apps command`:

```
nuvolos apps
```
